            After layout and content strategy, It was time to set a
            theme and colour palette It was time to design a simple,
            clean and elegant showcase website. The accent colour I
            choose was Dark moderate cyan.. Later on while project was
            in design phase I chamged the theme from Cyan to Gradient feel,
            to make it more contrast and modern feel.
            I decided to use red as theme colour
