The humble weather app is one that is used by many on a daily basis. It is informative, features little copy and uses visual elements to convey data. Weather applications need to be dynamic in design, and be able to convey different states of weather to the users clearly and creatively.

### Technologies used

The web application was built using Node.js; React on the front end. Geolocating was handled by the MapBox API, and allows for autofill search when geocoding strings. The Dark Sky API was used to fill the web application with dynamic weather data and axiois was used to aid with the API calling process.

Minimal animations were made possible by react-spring and styling was handled with styled-components. Local Storage was used to store and remember user data allowing users to view the weather data straight away upon their return.
